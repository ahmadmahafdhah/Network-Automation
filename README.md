# Simple-Network-Automation

First Python script "script.py" acts as a minimalist network automation program.
The script sends the required command to a Cisco router, and receives and displays its output in a convenient, well-formatted manner, using regex library.
The script is self executable, an it takes one command line argument which is the <router IP address>.
fro example, it should run like: ./script <router IP>
